# Augmentations for the Unknown
This repository contains the official implementation of "Data-Agnostic Augmentations for Unknown Variations - Out-of-Distribution Generalisation in MRI Segmentation", presented at MIDL 2025.

Our work explores novel data augmentation techniques designed to improve model generalization in medical imaging, especially in scenarios with unseen domain shifts and rare cases.
